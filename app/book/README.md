# Book API

This api is created with python by using flask as the api framework. 

## Install

1. Make sure you have python 3.9 installed. 
  
  This can be done by

  ```shell
  brew install pipenv
  ```

  Install missed packages by executing:

  ```sh
  pipenv install
  ```

  Install new packages by executing:
  
  ```sh
